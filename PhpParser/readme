*********************
*** PhpParser 1.2 ***
*********************

PhpParser generates a pure Java parser for PHP programs. Invoking this parser 
yields an explicit parse tree suitable for further analysis.

This package is based upon:

- JFlex 1.4.1 (www.jflex.de).
- Cup 0.10k (www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/).
- Grammar and lexer specifications of PHP 4.3.10.

The modifications to JFlex and Cup have been documented in the files inside
the directory doc/modifications.


BUILDING
**********

You can build PhpParser by installing Ant (ant.apache.org) and typing

ant build

inside the directory of this README.


USAGE
*******

All you need to do in order to use the generated PhpParser is


- copy the directories 

  build/class/at 
  and
  build/class/java_cup

  into your project and make their parent directory part of your classpath


- add the following import statement to the Java file which shall invoke PhpParser

  import at.ac.tuwien.infosys.www.phpparser.*;


- create the parse tree for a file given by "fileName" in the following way:

  PhpLexer lexer = new PhpLexer(new FileReader(fileName));
  lexer.setFileName(fileName);
  PhpParser parser = new PhpParser(lexer);
  ParseNode rootNode = (ParseNode) parser.parse().value;


The last two statements must be enclosed by a matching try-catch clause. The 
directory doc/example contains a simple usage example that parses one or more
PHP files and prints the lexemes of the parse tree nodes. It can be compiled by 
changing into that directory and typing

javac -classpath ../../build/class Example.java

Execute it by typing

java -classpath ../../build/class:. Example test1.php test2.php


For more information, see the Javadoc inside doc/html. It is generated along
with building the project.
