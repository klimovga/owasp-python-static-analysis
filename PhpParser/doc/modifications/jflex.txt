Modifications to JFlex 1.4.1
*****************************

- marked with "NJ"

- modified files:
  - skeleton.default
  - Emitter.java

- reasons:
  - emulation of Flex's yymore()

- state stacks are emulated without modifying the JFlex sources, simply by
  including the relevant data structures into the specification file
