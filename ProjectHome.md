During 2007 Dmitry Kozlov, Igor Konnov and Georgy Klimov prototyped taint-style static analysis for Python web applications. This tool is based on Pixy project. It is able to find input validation security vulnerabilities in Python-based web applications. This tool is currently in alfa release. It supports limited subset of Python: functions, modules, classes and data structures, but not generators, comprehensions, lambda-functions etc. And it has support only mod\_python web applications.
